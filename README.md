We propose ODB-dLLM, an arithmetic intensity inspired framework for accelerating diffusion-based large language models. By analyzing the interleaved compute- and memory-bound phases in existing dLLM inference frameworks, ODB-dLLM introduces adaptive length prediction strategy and jump-share speculative decoding to optimize computation-memory characteristics on hardware platforms, thereby maximizing inference efficiency.
